... more a note for myself

Found a discussion that gives a few very nice examples of WPF applied in real world, line-of-business applications: [WPF LOB samples](http://groups.google.com/group/wpf-disciples/browse_thread/thread/194800c0415afcba/034ce451669f0a7f). 

I can't stop be amazed by what degree of flexibility WPF is giving to designers and application developers. Having an artistic sense and willingness to create "something" you can do really nice, usable & nice looking applications.

**Update**: reviewed some of my notes, found another great LOB sample, not listed in previous discussion: [Great User Experience Example in a Business Application](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/07/07/great-user-experience-example-in-a-business-application.aspx). 

**Update**: Seen on [Davy Brion](http://davybrion.com/blog/)'s blog: [How should your business applications look like](http://www.itemsolutions.com/products/products2/interfaces). Few very interesting ideas there.
