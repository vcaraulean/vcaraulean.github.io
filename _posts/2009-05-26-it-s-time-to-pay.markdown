Heard today, from devs working on an old & big project:

> Hey, check that file at line **11108** and try...

That's... breathtaking...

To be clear, they are talking about source code file from a project that is in continuous maintenance mode, with new functionality and bug fixes added with regularity. 

**Definition**

> **Technical debit** - obligation that a software organization incurs when it chooses a design or construction approach that's expedient in the short term but that increases complexity and is more costly in the long term.

[Technical debit by Steve McConnell](http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2007/11/01/technical-debt-2.aspx):

> If the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets. A common example is a legacy code base in which so much work goes into keeping a production system running (i.e., "servicing the debt") that there is little time left over to add new capabilities to the system.
