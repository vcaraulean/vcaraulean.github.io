title: My biggest failure this year ...
categories: [general]

... was to choose [Microsoft's implementation if Ribbon](http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=WPF%20Ribbon%20Preview) to use in our current development. Yes, I knew it was released as beta. But I hoped to have frequent enough releases from MS to keep up with user's feedback & fixing bugs. It was my error. 

The [usual feedback](http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=40365) from MS on questions and bug reports is:

> Thanks for reporting this issue. This is a known issue and will be addressed in our V1 release. In the meantime, unfortunately, you'll only be able to ... until we release a fix. 

The problem is that the Ribbon was released in October 2008. Since then, nothing like a bug fix release was provided. No known date of the next version to be released. No intermediary releases with bug fixes. Nothing.

We lost significant time working around bugs & bad implementation. It's completely my fault. I should choose a commercial component to achieve our goals.

Do you want to know my **second biggest failure**? 

Choosing for our project [WPF Themes](http://wpf.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=WPF%20Themes) also provided by Microsoft. Why it failed? See above. Bugs that make you spend time fixing weird behaviors instead of providing value for the client.

What I'll do now with all this crap in our projects? I don't know yet. But I know for sure, that I'll never ever use any betas (of developer products) provided by Microsoft in a real development. At the end it costs you too much...
