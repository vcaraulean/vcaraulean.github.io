The session was truly entertaining. David Gageot ([@dgageot](http://twitter.com/#!/dgageot)) talked about Git and Mockito.

The talk about Git was interesting. I’m using already DVCS (Git grace to GitHub and Mercurial because of better Windows experience) but I’m very far from being an advanced Git user. Learnt few tweaks, both for Git and for presenting. It was interesting to see how David started presentation about git by showing an advanced feature, bisecting, for an auditory that was for most not familiar with DVCS and Git. Also enjoyed looking at reactions when you’re showing them how they can be more productive. I’ve seen people being very impressed, asking questions. But also seen reactions like “subversion is simpler” to “I enjoy a coffee while updating my working copy with svn". And (a true horror story, it’s almost 2011) some people are still using CVS. 

Then there was an intro to Mockito, a mocking framework for Java. It is very similar by idea and syntax to Rhino.Mocks and Moq from .NET world. Just, a Java penalty, mocks a little bit more verbose when compared with C#. And, surprise, no XML during whole presentation. Kidding :)

It's very interesting to listen to David. Really passionate about software development, productivity and best practices...
