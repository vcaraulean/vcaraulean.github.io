title: How we get inspiration...

That’s interesting to observe how we’re getting influenced by things around us. How world we see and experience is determining **what** and **how** we do. Most of the time we’re not sensing the source of our actions and decisions. It’s very subtle. And often the “it feels right” moments are a sign that experience we’ve got, processed and incorporated is applied without realizing what exactly is done right...

But not this case:

I’m working on Windows Phone 7 application (yes, [mGitHub](http://mgithub.com/) and btw it’s already available in marketplace) in my spare time and weekends and I own a WP7 device which I really like. So, there was no surprise when I’ve seen that **Metro UI**, the visual style of Windows Phone 7 platform, influenced me and leaked in this screen that is part of a Silverlight application. 

Asked people what they think, got mostly positive appreciations. It would be interesting to see how this concept will evolve. It’s only an early sketch, done by a “more developer than designer”. How you like it?
