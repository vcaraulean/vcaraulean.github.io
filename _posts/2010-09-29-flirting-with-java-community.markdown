title: Flirting with Java community

Despite my [enthusiasm about finding and participating](/blog/2009/11/26/alt-net-swiss-community-its-running/) in a regional .NET user group, the [Alt.NET Suisse](http://www.altnetfr.org/lausanne/) haven’t got enough traction to keep on rolling and now it’s actually not functioning.

So, to keep my community-and-knowledge-hungry spirit quiet, I [keep visiting regional Java User Groups](/blog/2010/01/31/have-been-in-the-aliens-camp-twice/). The last two session I’ve took part where on some emerging topics, not strictly related to Java. For me, a .NET developer, that is a ticket to visit these meetings.

The “**Not only SQL (NoSQL)**” session at [JUG Lausanne](http://jugl.ch/) on September 9, was interesting not by presentation about NoSQL and the hype around it, but by half-way discussion that hijacked permanently the presentation. But at the end, it was not a bad thing. It was very interesting to hear how people are planning to use or already using NoSQL in real world projects. 

“**Hibernate – strategies for caching and data loading**” was yesterday at [JUG Geneve](http://www.genevajug.ch/). The topic was somewhat familiar for me, as we’re using extensively [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org) in our projects. Initially, NHibernate was a .NET port of popular Java ORM – Hibernate. They are still very similar in concepts, features and scope, but I do see that NHibernate got new features that were not ported from his big brother. Linq provider, Futures, fluent/code mapping are first that are coming in my mind. 

Few random thoughts and impressions after the session:

 * nothing new for me, but a good recapitulation of options available to improve performance of your data layer 
 * I do like C# over Java as a general purpose programming language. It’s easier to read, laconic and just cleaner when compared to Java 
 * are the Java guys really struck into XML? I’ve seen yesterday more XML than in whole last few months 
 * Alain Helaili, the presenter, used dynaTrace to show how various tweaks are affecting performance in test cases. It’s a kind of instrumentation framework for Java that has an integration point with Hibernate. Functionality is in some parts similar to latest improvements in Visual Studio 2010, IntelliTrace debugging. And it’s a typical example of “developer oriented interface” with all corresponding usability quirks 

Overall, I’m very pleased meeting Java community. Looking forward to next sessions that are not too java-centric to make interest for a mere .NET Developer.
