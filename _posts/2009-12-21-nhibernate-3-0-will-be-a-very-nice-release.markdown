title: NHibernate 3.0 will be a very nice release
categories: [nhibernate]

First of all, [Steve Strong](http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/sstrong/Default.aspx) made a Christmas gift to community by presenting a [new Linq implementation](http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2009/12/17/linq-to-nhibernate-progress-report-a-christmas-gift.aspx) for [NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/), which is now incorporated in the trunk. Kudos for a such great work!

Another valuable addition to NHibernate is the [QueryOver<T> API](http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2009/12/17/queryover-in-nh-3-0.aspx) that wrapped ICriteria API and made it easier to use. Thanks to [Richard Brown](http://broloco.blogspot.com/).

Both features are not crucial for the success of NHibernate, but they are very nice improvements that will attract new users and will keep the old ones. It's easier to advocate for NHibernate when you can point not only at his advanced features. The hype around Linq makes difference when features are compared. Having a provider for NHibernate will be a strong decision argument.

I hope that soon after New Year's holidays I'll try to switch to NHibernate 3.0. If migration of our project will be painless and all tests will still green, I think we'll run with the trunk. It's the least we can do to help make this project better.
