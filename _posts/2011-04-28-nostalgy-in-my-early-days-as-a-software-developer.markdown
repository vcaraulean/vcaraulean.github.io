title: Nostalgy. My early days as a software developer ...

Something brought up old memories from the days when I’ve been working in Embedded Systems development.

I’m third from the left...

The “big thing” in the back is a Diesel engine stripped from a big ship. Converted to an internal combustion engine working on natural gas and producing 6 Megawatts of Electrical power. Cooling/heating, turbo, oiling, ignition – those are only few subsystems of this complex.

My former employer, [Romany Gaz Group](http://rgg.md), done all the electronics + software. It was a blast to work on. A mix of hardware, microprocessors and software, low level hacking and unforgettable feeling of true Research and Development work:

  * writing in assembler for mythical Motorola 68HC11, an 8-bit microprocessor with a whopping 64 Kb of program memory and less than 1 Kb of RAM. Then come the HC12 with more memory and C compiler. 
  * in-house Real-Time Operational System with multi-tasking support. 
  * “advanced” user interfaces on 20x4 character displays and 5 button keyboards 
  * homebrew communication protocol spawning into few levels of OSI model 
  * tens of sensors and digital signals 
  * tens of output signals, valves, pumps 
  * a SCADA-like PC application for monitoring and control 

And a fantastic team of talented engineers that tamed the beast. You have to hear it grumble...
