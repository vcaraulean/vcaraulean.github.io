title: Quick tip - if Git can't find your global config...
categories: [tools]

If youâ€™ve put (or want to put) your **.gitconfig** in your home directory (`C:\Users\username\`) and git cannot find it you may try to add a user variable called **HOME** and set it to **%USERPROFILE%**.

See screenshot for details:

Useful commands:
    
    git config --global -l 
    git config --global -e

First will show your global configuration file, second will try open it to edit.
