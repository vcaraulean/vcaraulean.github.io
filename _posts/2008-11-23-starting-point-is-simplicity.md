The [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1414-a-complex-system-that-works-is-invariably) quoted: 

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.

Reading this remind me principles of agile software development, "release early, release often" way of Open Source Software world and my own indestructible certainty in the fact that a simple working software released today is much better than a complex and over-engineered beast to-be-released-when-it-is-done.

A software is always a solution. Let's build first a solution of client's problem, thereafter we'll add to application all that crap backed in typical business application, like report designers, integration points with 10 external systems and data export in 100 formats. Do the core. Release it. Then go back and do the rest 80% of application that will be used by less than 20% of customers.
