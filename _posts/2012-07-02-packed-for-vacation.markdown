categories: [general]

It’s that happy time again, a (well deserved I think) vacation. Beach, sea, great food & drinks and, of course, lot’s of time to spend with family.

### Reading list

  * [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/)  
  * [Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability by Steve Krug](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/)
  * [The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107/)
  * Selected chapters from [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html). 

And will be sharing with my wife some novels in French to improve a bit my (still bad in my opinion) French language skills.

### Videos

Downloaded the torrent with [videos of all sessions from NDC 2012](http://www.ndcoslo.com/Article/News/2012video). 25 GB of goodness, that should keep my entertained some time. Watching videos is much more time consuming action than reading a book (and, usually, less dense in information & message they convey), so I’d be picking only a handful of sessions to go trough...
