title: User experience and hardware updates
---

Had to install from zero a **Dell notebook** recently. Yes, my new development rig. Apart of Windows installation experience (very simplistic in essence & straightforward) had to install latest drivers for all notebook’s hardware. Typically, process looked like this:

  * go to Dell’s site 
  * look up the latest driver for device you want 
  * download it 
  * run it – it’s a **.exe** file. 
  * done! 

And today I want to update device drivers for my older netbook: **Asus 1000H**. I wanted to start with updating the BIOS. 

  * Got to Asus support site, 
  * found the latest BIOS version 
  * downloaded it 
  * it’s a **.rom** file. 
  * full stop! 

Guess then, which portable device I’ll buy next? Definitely, not an Asus. 

Got in mind the "Don’t make me think" by Steven Krug...

PS. It’s always small touches and details that makes the experience polarized: love/hate is one detail away...
