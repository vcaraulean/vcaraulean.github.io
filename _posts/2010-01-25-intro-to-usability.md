I just finished watching a [video about basics of Usability](http://blip.tv/file/1557737). Before, I’ve read few articles and blog posts on the topic , but this video gives a nice introduction in Usability basics and Usability Testing so that I’ll save it in the blog. The speaker is Steve Krug, author of “Don’t make me think”, book sitting in my “to be read” list and just moved higher in the queue. 

The thing I liked the most is how “cheap” are usability improvements. Change the caption of the button, remove that cryptic description, move important things higher and hide functions being rarely used. 

And test it. Iteratively. It’s agile on it’s better form – pick a user or two and just let them do something useful in your app. Notice errors, fix it. 

And test it, again...
