I had to review few tens of CV lately. A very interesting pattern emerged when we looked at the CVs that were taken to next level - preliminary interviews.

Almost all selected CVs were well written, had little to no spelling errors (a very cheap improvement actually, why everybody isn't using it?), structured, had clean and consistent formatting.

Programming, like many other human activities, is all about communication: talking within your team, interacting with the clients and the most important - writing down your ideas using your favorite programming language.

When somebody is writing a CV I hope he wants to say something. And we're ready to listen to everyone who can describe in clean and short manner his achievements, explain clearly his goals, expose himself efficiently and maybe entertain us with a story. In this case, there is a big chance that he will be able to write (for example) the code to export an hierarchical data structure in few output formats using Visitor pattern.

Yes, peer recommendations are still an important channel to get fresh blood, but in any case - "all is starting with a CV".
