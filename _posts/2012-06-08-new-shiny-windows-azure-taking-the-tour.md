title: 'New & shiny Windows Azure: taking the Tour'
categories: [ui-ux, tools]

How there is a lot of buzz in last few days about [revamped Windows Azure](http://windowsazure.com), I cannot resist anymore and I’m giving it a try.

I’ve read few blog posts about new features, Metro style UI & improved tooling. But I was surprised by what I have seen when I logged in and tried to open the “Manage” part: the** Windows Azure Tour** application.

Instead of throwing the newcomer directly into Management panel, it offers you to take a tour and get some concepts of application and how to interact with it.

The idea itself is not new. [Clippy the Office Assistant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) is the (annoying) forgotten hero born to help people dig into Office applications. More often other companies are offering a video introduction for their products or a series of “text + screenshots” slides to quickly explain usage of the product to new users.

The approach Microsoft took with Windows Azure Tour is a bit different:

  * It runs “within” application itself, giving impression of having the main application in background
  * It gradually exposes application’s features in the same window  
  * Features are shown in exact same place where they are in application  
  * It looks & works great

And I quite like their Wizard-like walkthrough dialog. Smooth and subtle animations, clear visual indication of steps and current position, a bold exposure of Metro/Windows 8 style. I’m very tempted to try reproduce it in XAML...

Few more screenshots:

Finishing the Tour will take you to the main application screen:

That’s just my first impression about Azure. And most often is the one that counts the most. I think Microsoft have done a great job for presenting the new Azure. Let’s see now how it will be in real usage...

PS: If you haven’t seen the previous Azure portal, here is a screenshot:
