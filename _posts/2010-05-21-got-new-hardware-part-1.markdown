title: Got new hardware - part 1
---

I have new monitor: [Dell UltraSharp 2209WA](http://accessories.dell.com/sna/products/displays/productdetail.aspx?c=ca&l=en&s=corp&sku=320-7825).

What I like:

  * Slick design. Breathes style and functionality. 
  * Panel: IPS. Crisp visual elements. Wonderful colors.
  * Functionality: adjustable height, portrait mode, USB hubs.
  * Brightness is set to 12% and it’s well enough.

Working on wide angles and big resolution will need a bit of accommodation and changing some habits. 

It looks nice, image quality is top. I think I’ll be loving it...
