title: On motivation, a quote...
---

From “[How will you measure your life?](http://www.amazon.com/Will-Measure-Your-Life-ebook/dp/B006ID0CH4/)”:

> The theory of motivation suggests you need to ask yourself a different set of questions than most of us are used to asking. Is this work meaningful to me? Is this job going to give me a chance to develop? Am I going to learn new things? Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement? Am I going to be given responsibility? These are the things that will truly motivate you. Once you get this right, the more measurable aspects of your job will fade in importance.

After starting reading this book I find myself divided. Sometimes I’m eager to go read it in one go up to the late night. Next day I’m closing it after a chapter or just a paragraph that I want to “process”. A very strange feeling. 

But a really great reading...
