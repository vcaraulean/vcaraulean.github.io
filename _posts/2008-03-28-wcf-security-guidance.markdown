title: WCF Security Guidance
categories: [development, wcf]
---

It seems to be that Patterns & Practices team continues to do what they do the best - creating guidance within different development areas. 

The last release of this group is the [WCF Security Guidance](http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurity/). It contains description for a few application scenarios & a list of various How-Tos, including few video walkthroughs of common WCF solutions.

It's different from usual way to dig into WCF infrastructure details. It's not crawling over hundreds of MSDN pages, it's not like reading MSDN samples trying to understand what's going on.

It is a very detailed step-by-step description on how to do some tasks touching different aspects of WCF, starting from opening a certificates store, and ending with deployment advices.

Keep it going, P&P!
