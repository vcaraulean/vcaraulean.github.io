title: '... if you want to invest in your skills'

If it will be only one conference that I'd be allowed to attend during one... no, two... tree... years it will be the [Norwegian Developers Conference 2009](http://www.ndc2009.no/en/).

Absolutely fantastic speakers line-up:

  * Jeremy Miller 
  * Ayende Rahien
  * Glenn Block
  * Robert C. Martin
  * Jimmi Nilsson
  * Udi Dahan
  * ... and more...

Each of these speakers are well known in software development community by their contributions to open-source projects or by efforts they do to promote best values and practices in software engineering, sharing experience and teaching mere mortals.

Extraordinary agenda, tracks and talks. If I'd be able to go there, sure I'll find a way to divide myself to see as much possible parallel tracks.

If you're searching for best investments for your money in a tough economic climate, you've found it: your skills and Norwegian Developers Conference.
