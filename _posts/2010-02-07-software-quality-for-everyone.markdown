title: Software quality for everyone
categories: [general]
---

Have just read another definition of what is software quality on Jeremy D. Miller’s blog:

> defining software quality as the structural qualities of code structure that enable a team to be productive within that codebase for an extended amount of time

Jeremy is writing on how to achieve the quality in: [Patterns in Practice: A Retrospective](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2010/01/11/patterns-in-practice-a-retrospective.aspx). For those who cares about the quality of the software you’re building you have to go over the series of the articles that Jeremy has written for MSDN Magazine. 

If you want to be a better developer you may not have enough time to read ~10 books, watch screen casts, attend presentations or conferences, buy costly tools and courses. The cheapest was is just take a half an hour each day over a week and go read those publications. And think about it...
