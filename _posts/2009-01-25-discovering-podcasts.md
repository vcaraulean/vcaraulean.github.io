title: Discovering podcasts...
---

Until last week I was indifferent to podcasts. Not really indifferent - I knew they exists, a lot of people likes them, they're about things that sometimes are interesting for me. But I had absolutely no time to listen to them... Blogs & mailing lists are my choice to feed my knowledge and laziness demons...

Being car-less lately, offered me an opportunity to dig into podcast's world. In my 30-40 minutes commuting I've start listening to audio feeds. So far, my preferred are:

  * [Alt.NET Podcast](http://altnetpodcast.com/)  
  * [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/)  
  * [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/)  
  * [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/)  
  * [Elegant Code Cast](http://elegantcode.com/category/codecast/)

Despite relatively slow informational flow and manageability (it's way easier to re-read a phrase than rewind an audio stream for an interesting passage, or diagonal read versus jump back & forth to skip something) podcasts made my commuting a bit more enjoyable.

An Update: Scott Hanselman (the author of Hanselminutes cited earlier) is asking his readers about their favorite developer-oriented podcasts, and publishing his own favorites: [Hanselman List of Podcasts for .NET Programmers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselmanListOfPodcastsForNETProgrammers.aspx). Very impressive list to compliment my own. 

Happy listening...
