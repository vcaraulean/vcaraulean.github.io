I know, it’s late, but this…


> **FatalExecutionEngineError** was detected         
Message: The runtime has encountered a fatal error. The address of the error was at 0xf8b96934, on thread 0x147c. The error code is 0xc0000005. This error may be a bug in the CLR or in the unsafe or non-verifiable portions of user code. Common sources of this bug include user marshaling errors for COM-interop or PInvoke, which may corrupt the stack.

Is it the way how CLR is saying "time to go home"?
